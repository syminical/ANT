This is the design documentation for A.N.T. (Android Notifications and Texts)

This project will have a mobile app for android, and a PC program (for windows, maybe Mac/Linux too).
The PC program can display the notifications list from the phone, show new notifications, read and send text messages remotely, and has some settings for customization.
The app can register new connections with a PC, list all connections it has, close connections, and it has some settings.

Desktop Program (ANT-1):

   LANGUAGE: Java (Springboot?) or Python

   FEATURES:
      1.) Drop/paste/select files to phone.
      2.) Share clipboard to phone. (text)

Mobile App (ANT-2):

   LANGUAGE: Java?

   PERMISSIONS:
      - Notifications list
      - New notifications
      - always running?
      - no notification icon?
      - Contacts? (might be needed to send txts)
      - phone state? (idk if ANT-2 needs to stop during calls)
      - storage (settings and connections)

BOTH:

   * 2-way communication
      - Both need to be able to make and answer requests.
      1. REST API webserver
      2. Sockets?
   
   FEATURES:
      0.) Tutorial
           - One-time-thing auto run, then can be redone.
            ANT-1:
             - Click through, ESC anytime.
            ANT-2:
             - Swipe card tutorial explaining features, skip anytime.
      1.) Registration
            ANT-1:
             - Generates a QR code that needs to be scanned.
             - Data sharing options (what information ANT-1 requests / can work with).
            ANT-2:
             - The ANT-2 tries to take a picture of a QR code from ANT-1, which will be displayed on a monitor.
                - Ant-1 & Ant-2 can now communicate and set up encryption.
             - ANT-2 should get some data from the QR code:
                1. ANT-1's (W)LAN name + PC address.
                    - Notify the user if the phone is not on that network.
                2. Any data sharing preferences selected in ANT-1.
      2.) Registered Connections List
           - Display all connections.
              - connection state is also shown (ACTIVE, INACTIVE)
           - Connections can be redone (new QR code), deleted, or hibernated.
              - Hibernated connections are forced into an inactive state until the user wakes them up in the app.
           - Each connection has settings to control what information is shared between ANTs.
             - New connections can be added.
      3.) Connection Settings
           - Sharing options are shown for a specific connection.
             - Notifications List
             - New Notifications
             - Existing Text Message Conversations
             - Sending New Text Messages
             - Contacts?
